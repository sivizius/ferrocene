Ferrocene
=========

Ferrocene is a library to draw mutlitple frames of varoius type in several tiling modes on multiple displays.
It can be used e.g. to create similar interfaces to ncurses in terminals.

About the Name
--------------

Ferrocene is a so called sandwich-compound containing Iron in oxidations state +II and two cyclopentadienyl ligands.
It is a orange, crytalline and nice looking substance with a good smelling odor.
There are a lot of awesome ferrocenyl compouds that studied e.g. for their electochemial nature (ever heared of mixed-valence compounds?).
Anyway, Ferrocene is, like Rust (Iron(III)-oxides and -hydroxides), a redish-coloured substance.
But while Rust is not a very good looking and defined substance, Ferrocene is.

Installation
------------

Just compile it with:
```
cargo build --features [features]
```

Available features are at the moment:

* `display-tty` for output on terminals.
